        Good Morning Respected Sir/Mam
        
        Django-Project Creation:
        --------------------------------
                - python -V
                - django-admin --version
                - django-admin startproject "projectname"
                        -> It automatically creates Admin app with Project name
        -> To run a server we need to run a command that is "python manage.py runserver"
        
        User Creation App:
        -------------------------
        -> We need to navigate for project location
        -> so we need to run a command in command prompt for creation of a user app
                - django-admin startapp "userappname"
        
        Configuring Admin app in Settings.py,Urls.py and in Userapp creating a function in Views.py:
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        -> In FDP3 you can observe settings.py so in this file we need to register our app (i.e., Application definition).
        
        -> We need to open urls.py just we need to add url path and our app function
                we need to import our app to this location
                -> from myapp import views
                
        we need to give a path for that function
                -> urlpatterns =[
                        path('hi/',views.hello,name="hq"),
                ]
                -> hi -> url that can be entered in browser
                -> hello -> to perform that action
                -> name -> forms -> linking
Response with parameters in an url:
------------------------------------------
                => http://localhost:8000/s/raju->User
                        
                        Hello Good Morning raju
                
                => url
                        -> path('s/<str:r>/',views.hg),
                => views
                        -> def hg(request,r):
                                return HttpResponse("Hello "+r)


        HTML,CSS,Javascript,Jquery:
        ===========================
        Html -> Templates => .html 
        
        url:
        -----
        path('rw/<str:name>/',views.fr),,
        
        views:
        --------
        def fr(re,name):
                return render(re,'myapp/sample.html')
        
        render:
        --------
        render(re,'.html',{})
        
        Templates: -> myapp -> sample.html
                           -> usr -> sample.html
Templates:
-------------
        -> We need to create a folder with a name templates that should be inner of userapp
        -> Inner of Templates folder we need to create another folder with userappname
        -> There it self we need to create our .html files

         * by using id
         * by using class

Yesterday Topics Covered:
        -------------------------
                -> Data sending from url to .html
                -> Created Form and applied some styling for that form
                -> Styling to a form by using selectors like tagname(i.e., element,), id, class.
                -> Different ways to apply styling to a .html
                
        Good Morning Respected Sir/Mam
        
        CSS:
        ====
        Inline -> This can be used in inner of a start tag that can be changed by using property:value
        Internal -> This styling should be used with a style tag 
                elementname,idname,classname 
                property:value
                -> This internal style should be inner of head tag
        External -> We need to pass all those styling to another .css file that should be accessed within a head tag
                Ex:
                first.css
                
                h1
                {
                        //property:value;
                        color:black;
                }
                
                <head>
                <link rel="stylsheet" href="" type="text/css">        
                </head>
        
        css,js,images -> external files -> static
        
        Static:
        -------
        -> We need to create static folder inner of our app
        -> After creation then we need to create another folder for accessing .css files
        -> css -> .css
        -> js -> .js
        -> images -> .jpg,.png, images extensions
        
        urls:
        -----
        path('exc/',views.extc)
        
        Views:
        ------
        def extc(request):
                return render(request,'reg.html')
        
        
        
        inline -> it will not breaks for new line
        Ex: span,i
        block -> it will displays in new line
        Ex: div 


        first.css
        ----------
        form
        {
                background-color: cadetblue;
                margin-left: 30%;
                margin-right: 30%;
                margin-top: 70px;
        }
